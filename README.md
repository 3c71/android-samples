## Can I run this app?

If you actually want to run this sample app (though it is mostly provided so you
can read the code), you will need to register an OAuth 2.0 client for the
package `com.google.android.gms.drive.sample.demo` with your own debug keys
and set any resource IDs to those that you have access to.
