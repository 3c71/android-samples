    // When including the Google Play Services library in your application you have two options:

    // Option 1: Include all of Google Play services (enables better auto-complete), but you should
    // be sure to use "minifyEnabled" on any APKs you upload to the Google Play store.
    // compile 'com.google.android.gms:google-play-services:7.0.+'

    // Option 2: Include lower level libraries if you are using Google Play services v6.5 or
    // greater. A detail of the client libs can be found at https://goo.gl/jKNdLm.
    // Note: If you use a service that has a specific client lib you DO NOT need to depend on
    // the "base" lib as it is included transitively. The "base" lib is included below for
    // documentation purposes but is not required in this sample's current configuration.
